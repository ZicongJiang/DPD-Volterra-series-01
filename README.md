# DPD-Volterra-series
 use volterra series to get the nonlinear function from nonlinear system.<br>
 The result of simulation can be found at "Simple report in pdf/01-Simulation volterra series.pdf".<br>
 The code file is  "Volterra series code.mlx"
 
 Task02: Theory SER and Simulated SER for 2PAM, 4PAM, 8PAM, OOK. SER for 4PAM after MZM modulation, and the result after using Volterra series. code "PAM4 and OOK".
